# Model Evaluation and Refinement in Python

This repository contains projects and code from my recently completed course, **"Data Analysis with Python"**, where I explored key statistical concepts and implemented them using Python.

## Key Topics Covered:
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to assess model performance.
- **Over-fitting & Under-fitting**: Understanding and handling bias-variance trade-off.
- **Model Selection**: Approaches for choosing the best model.
- **Ridge Regression**: Implementing regularization to reduce over-fitting.
- **Grid Search**: Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Libraries Used:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `ipywidgets`

Explore the code to see how these concepts were applied and how you can refine your models for better accuracy. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
